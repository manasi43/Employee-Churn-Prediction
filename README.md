# Project Overview

This project predicts whether an employee will stay or leave the organization based on factors like satisfaction level, evaluation score, number of projects, working hours, promotions, etc.

I trained multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and selected Random Forest as the final model since it gave the highest accuracy.

I also built a Tkinter GUI to allow users to input employee details and get predictions in real-time.
